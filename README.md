# Anti CombatLog Feature for Roleplay Servers

![Anti CombatLog](https://github.com/AmiRobin-FiveM/ARS-Anti-CombatLog/assets/22963668/31036bd1-a50e-4446-a261-638bb9671392)


This script provides a solution to combat logging incidents in roleplay servers. Often, players find themselves in situations where someone abruptly disconnects during combat, making it difficult to identify the player responsible. With this script, you can prevent such situations from occurring.

## Features

- Easy configuration: You can easily configure the script by modifying the `config.lua` and `webhook.lua` files. Additionally, there is a Discord Integration config available.
- 3D Text display: The script includes a feature that displays a 3D text only if you are within 15 units of the logout position.

## Installation

1. Download the script files from the KeyMaster.
2. Place the script files in the appropriate directory of your FiveM server.
3. Configure the script by modifying the `config.lua` and `server.lua` files as per your server's requirements.
4. Restart your FiveM server to apply the changes.

## Usage

Once the script is installed and configured, it will automatically handle combat logging incidents in your roleplay server. Players will no longer be able to disconnect during combat without consequences.
